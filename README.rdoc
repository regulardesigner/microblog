## How to install your microblog.

First clone the repos on your computer

```sh
git clone https://github.com/regulardesigner/microblog.git

bundle install

rake db:migrate
```

## Then you have to create your administrator account (with the rails console) to be able to create and save articles.

```sh
$ MyAdminAccount = Admin.create(:email => "youremailaddress@gmail.com", :password => "yourpassord")
$ MyAdminAccount.save
```
That's it!
