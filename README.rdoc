## How to install your microblog.

First clone the repos on your computer

$ git clone

$ bundle install

$ rake db:migrate

## Then you have to create your administrator account (with the rails console) to be able to create and save articles.

$ MyAdminAccount = Admin.create(:email => "youremailaddress@gmail.com", :password => "yourpassord")
$ MyAdminAccount.save

That's it!
